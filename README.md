> Overview
* Self-training project, developed by _**[Practicum100 and Yandex Web Developer Program](https://practicum.yandex.com/)**_, executed by me.  
* This single-page website designed according to the **B**lock-**E**lement-**M**odifier (BEM) methodology, which means that it contains several blocks ("units") that each one of them functions as a "self-entity" - it can be reuse and/or can be impliment elsewhere.
In addition, all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
